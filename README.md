Here's a **professional `README.md`** file for your Bike Servicing Management API project:


# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Servicing Management API

A backend API built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **TypeScript**, **Prisma ORM**, and **PostgreSQL** to streamline the process of managing customers, bikes, and service records for a bike servicing center. This API provides full CRUD operations with robust error handling, input validation, and overdue service tracking.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a backend system that allows a bike servicing center to:
- Register customers and their bikes.
- Track service records and statuses.
- Identify pending or overdue services.
- Perform full CRUD operations via RESTful endpoints.
